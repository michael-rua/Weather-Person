# MVP

* The user will be able to type a city name into a form and receive current weather information
* Based on the conditions in that city, they will see a message display which is relevant to the weather
* Below this, there is a recommendations tab which they click on (probably a hash route) which will display at least one other recommendation or weather relevant information, meme, etc

# Stretch (in no particular order)

* Utilise more APIs in the recommendations tab e.g. a game
* Display a map?
* Up our CSS game
* Create more routes or stateful components (e.g. on click etc)
* launch on Heroku
* refactor code





# General Outline of Tasks

For this project we are mainly working on the client side.

## Server Side
- Routes file - may not need anything added to it. (Need to check if the post route for the location input form needs to go here or on the client side in API function?)

## Client Side
- Api.js: use superagent to write function for Weather API - we want to take the input information from post route and insert it into the API function get request. This will return a JSON object from which we select the properties we would like to display (city name, max and min temperature in celsius, description (e.g. cloudy) etc)

- Based on the weather conditions, we will display a message in our component file (e.g. if sunny, display x)... One idea is we can have multiple options for each condition and the messages can be selected randomly.

- Hash route for Recommendations component: E.g. this could just display a specific photo from an API and perhaps a message to go with it. This also displays conditionally based on the weather condition.

- Components - there will be at least 3-4:
  - Location submit input
  - Weather conditions (from API)
  - Message of recommendation (string)
  - Recommendations (hash route) for displaying our other APIs




# A starter webpack project for React

This is a starter project that uses webpack to transpile and bundle ES6 React code. To use, consider these steps:

* Fork this repo
* Rename your repo according to the app you're building

```sh
git clone https://github.com/[your-account]/[your-app].git
cd [your-app] && npm i
```

To start the development server with a watcher that rebuilds your code, run `npm run dev`. The assets built by webpack are placed in `server/public`. This folder is defined as a static folder in an Express.js server that can be started with `npm run server`.

Additional components should be placed in `client/components`.

## Separate client/server

The boilerplate is also set up to host the client using `webpack-dev-server` with hot module reloading etc. To use this method, in one terminal run:
```sh
npm run client
```
and in the other:
```sh
npm run server
```
The client will be available on http://localhost:8080 and the server on http://localhost:3000. Note that you will still need to manage CORS between the two, as they are on different ports.
